    <div class="main" id="box1">The three kingdoms period of China</div>
    <div class="main" id="intro">Introduction</div>
    <div class="main" id="box2">
      The Three Kingdoms (simplified Chinese: 三国; traditional Chinese: 三國) from 220 to 280 AD was the
      tripartite division of China among the dynastic states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu.
      The Three Kingdoms period was preceded by the Eastern Han dynasty and was followed by the
      Western Jin dynasty. The short-lived state of Yan on the Liaodong Peninsula, which lasted from 237 to 238,
      is sometimes considered as a "4th kingdom".
      To distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of the same names,
      historians have added a relevant character to the state's original name: the state that
      called itself "Wei" (魏) is also known as "Cao Wei" (曹魏), the state that called itself "Han" (漢)
      is also known as "Shu Han" (蜀漢) or just "Shu" (蜀), and the state that called itself "Wu" (吳)
      is also known as "Eastern Wu" (東吳; Dōng Wú) or "Sun Wu" (孫吳).
      Academically, the period of the Three Kingdoms refers to the period between the
      establishment of Cao Wei in 220 and the conquest of the Eastern Wu by the Western Jin in 280.
      The earlier, "unofficial" part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic
      infighting between warlords in various parts of China during the downfall of the Eastern Han
      dynasty. The middle part of the period, from 220 to 263, was marked by a more
      militarily stable arrangement between three rival states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu.
      The later part of the era was marked by the conquest of Shu by Wei in 263, the usurpation of Cao
      Wei by the Western Jin in 266, and the conquest of Eastern Wu by the Western Jin in 280.
      The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in Chinese history. A nationwide census
      taken in 280 AD, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin shows a total
      of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960
      households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era.
      While the census may not have been particularly accurate due to a multitude of
      factors of the times, in 280, the Jin did make an attempt to account for all individuals
      where they could.
      Technology advanced significantly during this period. Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang invented the
      wooden ox, suggested to be an early form of the wheelbarrow, and improved on the repeating
      crossbow. Wei mechanical engineer Ma Jun is considered by many to be the equal of his
      predecessor Zhang Heng. He invented a hydraulic-powered, mechanical puppet theatre designed
      for Emperor Ming of Wei, square-pallet chain pumps for irrigation of gardens in Luoyang, and
      the ingenious design of the south-pointing chariot, a non-magnetic directional
      compass operated by differential gears.
      Although relatively short, this historical period has been
      greatly romanticized in the cultures of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.
      It has been celebrated and popularized in operas, folk stories, novels and in
      more recent times, films, television, and video games. The best known of these
      is Luo Guanzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a Ming dynasty historical novel
      based on events in the Three Kingdoms period. The authoritative historical
      record of the era is Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms, along with Pei
      Songzhi's later annotations of the text.
      The English-language term "Three Kingdoms" is something of a misnomer, since each state
      was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed suzerainty over all China.
      Nevertheless, the term "Three Kingdoms" has become standard among English-speaking sinologists.

      For my history project, I made a poster for a special type of sesame oil which is made during the three kingdom
      period in China. The picture down the poster shows how it is made, a donkey drags the piece of rock and grinds the
      sesame into powder, which is the most traditional way of making sesame oil. The poem on top left is about how Sun
      Quan used sesame oil as a weapon, which is also how sesame oil is originally used in China, people also generally
      believed that it is a weapon instead of seasoning material. The poem on the left illustrates about how sesame oils
      are used in foods as well, it changes the smell and flavor with just a few drops of it. The translation of the
      poem: “Sesame oils aren’t just used for wars, but also seasoning. Few drops of it makes food tasty, even with
      grass.” The central idea of this poster is to let citizens acknowledge that sesame oils can also be used for food.

      For my history project, I made a board game based on the historical Three Kingdoms time period. I based the
      mechanics of the game on real battles in the historical period, resources being a great factor in the game. This
      board game has heavy influence from Risk. Some of the most common interpretations of the time period are based on
      people, including the source used here. But I digress, maybe it was true for some monarchs, but the simple vision
      of the leader having "won" those fights is a vast oversimplification. So I based the system on the resources
      there, while allowing tactics at the same time. I also based the map of the game on the real map at the time.
      There are no borders and I also differentiated their role depending on how big the cities at the time. The board
      game is also complex enough that it's hard to predict an outcome.

    <div class="main" id="box7">Sword Of Goujian<br><br>

      Sword of Goujian is a tin bronze sword renowned for its unusual shape. It was found in 1965 in the Hubei
      provinces. The sword is generally attributed to Goujian, one of the last kings of Yue during the Spring and Autumn
      period. The sword was discovered in Jiangliand Country. The sword of Goujian is 55.6cm in length, including 8.4cm
      in hilt. A hilt is a handle of a weapon or tool. The body of the blade is mainly made of copper, making it more
      pliant and less likely to shatter. The sword had no signs of tarnish. Tarnish is a dullness of colour, or cause
      the sword or other things to luster.

    <div class="main" id="box9">My project is a poem made by myself that talks about the dynasty of three countries. The
      fou.r lines each standed for four big events that affected the going of the dynasty. The first line of the poem is
      about the great Zhu Geliang. He was a very smart person who can even control the goings of the winds and clouds.
      It was easy for him to win a battle. Therefore the army wanted him to be the leader. However, he did not want to
      do so and the army has visited his house for three times. Then he was willing to come up and negotiate with them.
      The second line is about one successful battle of Zhu Geliang, which he burned a field of farmings to win. The
      third line is still about the famous Zhu Geliang. It talks about he divided the dynasty into three big parts in
      order to exchange for peace. The last sentence is the end, which describes the death of Zhu Geliang. He died of a
      diease. After he died, the kingdom started to fall because of lost battles. So we can see that Zhu Geliang is very
      important for the dynasty of the three countries.
