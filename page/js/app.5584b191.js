The Three Kingdoms period was preceded by the Eastern Han dynasty and was followed by the Western Jin dynasty. The short-lived state of Yan on the Liaodong Peninsula, which lasted from 237 to 238, is sometimes considered as a "4th kingdom". To distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of the same names, historians have added a relevant character to the state\'s original name: the state that called itself "Wei" (魏) is also known as "Cao Wei" (曹魏), the state that called itself "Han" (漢) is also known as "Shu Han" (蜀漢) or just "Shu" (蜀), and the state that called itself "Wu" (吳) is also known as "Eastern Wu" (東吳; Dōng Wú) or "Sun Wu" (孫吳). Academically, the period of the Three Kingdoms refers to the period between the establishment of Cao Wei in 220 and the conquest of the Eastern Wu by the Western Jin in 280. The earlier, "unofficial" part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between warlords in various parts of China during the downfall of the Eastern Han dynasty. The middle part of the period, from 220 to 263, was marked by a more militarily stable arrangement between three rival states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The later part of the era was marked by the conquest of Shu by Wei in 263, the usurpation of Cao Wei by the Western Jin in 266, and the conquest of Eastern Wu by the Western Jin in 280. The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in Chinese history. A nationwide census taken in 280 AD, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin shows a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era. While the census may not have been particularly accurate due to a multitude of factors of the times, in 280, the Jin did make an attempt to account for all individuals where they could. Technology advanced significantly during this period. Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang invented the wooden ox, suggested to be an early form of the wheelbarrow, and improved on the repeating crossbow. Wei mechanical engineer Ma Jun is considered by many to be the equal of his predecessor Zhang Heng. He invented a hydraulic-powered, mechanical puppet theatre designed for Emperor Ming of Wei, square-pallet chain pumps for irrigation of gardens in Luoyang, and the ingenious design of the south-pointing chariot, a non-magnetic directional compass operated by differential gears. Although relatively short, this historical period has been greatly romanticized in the cultures of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. It has been celebrated and popularized in operas, folk stories, novels and in more recent times, films, television, and video games. The best known of these is Luo Guanzhong\'s Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a Ming dynasty historical novel based on events in the Three Kingdoms period. The authoritative historical record of the era is Chen Shou\'s Records of the Three Kingdoms, along with Pei Songzhi\'s later annotations of the text. The English-language term "Three Kingdoms" is something of a misnomer, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed suzerainty over all China. Nevertheless, the term "Three Kingdoms" has become standard among English-speaking sinologists. - Wikipedia, '),(0,o._)("i",null,"Three Kingdoms")],-1),x=(0,o._)("div",{class:"main",id:"box3"},null,-1),C=(0,o._)("img",{src:n,class:"main",id:"projectMap"},null,-1),j=(0,o._)("div",{class:"main",id:"box4"},[(0,o.Uk)("Guide"),(0,o._)("br"),(0,o._)("br"),(0,o.Uk)(" For my history project, I made a poster for a special type of sesame oil which is made during the three kingdom period in China. The picture down the poster shows how it is made, a donkey drags the piece of rock and grinds the sesame into powder, which is the most traditional way of making sesame oil. The poem on top left is about how Sun Quan used sesame oil as a weapon, which is also how sesame oil is originally used in China, people also generally believed that it is a weapon instead of seasoning material. The poem on the left illustrates about how sesame oils are used in foods as well, it changes the smell and flavor with just a few drops of it. The translation of the poem: “Sesame oils aren’t just used for wars, but also seasoning. Few drops of it makes food tasty, even with grass.” The central idea of this poster is to let citizens acknowledge that sesame oils can also be used for food.

I based the mechanics of the game on real battles in the historical period, resources being a great factor in the game. This board game has heavy influence from Risk. Some of the most common interpretations of the time period are based on people, including the source used here. But I digress, maybe it was true for some monarchs, but the simple vision of the leader having "won" those fights is a vast oversimplification. So I based the system on the resources there, while allowing tactics at the same time. I also based the map of the game on the real map at the time. There are no borders and I also differentiated their role depending on how big the cities at the time. The board game is also complex enough that it\'s hard to predict an outcome.

It was found in 1965 in the Hubei provinces. The sword is generally attributed to Goujian, one of the last kings of Yue during the Spring and Autumn period. The sword was discovered in Jiangliand Country. The sword of Goujian is 55.6cm in length, including 8.4cm in hilt. A hilt is a handle of a weapon or tool. The body of the blade is mainly made of copper, making it more pliant and less likely to shatter. The sword had no signs of tarnish. Tarnish is a dullness of colour, or cause the sword or other things to luster. <br> -Jackson </div><div class="main" id="box8">Hover to see recreation!<br><img id="SWARD2" src="'+r+'" class="electric boogaloo"><br>Masterpiece, right? </div><div class="main" id="box9">My project is a poem made by myself that talks about the dynasty of three countries. The fou.r lines each standed for four big events that affected the going of the dynasty. The first line of the poem is about the great Zhu Geliang. He was a very smart person who can even control the goings of the winds and clouds. It was easy for him to win a battle. Therefore the army wanted him to be the leader. However, he did not want to do so and the army has visited his house for three times. Then he was willing to come up and negotiate with them. The second line is about one successful battle of Zhu Geliang, which he burned a field of farmings to win. The third line is still about the famous Zhu Geliang. It talks about he divided the dynasty into three big parts in order to exchange for peace. The last sentence is the end, which describes the death of Zhu Geliang. He died of a diease. After he died, the kingdom started to fall because of lost battles. So we can see that Zhu Geliang is very important for the dynasty of the three countries. <br> -Bradley </div><div class="main" id="box10"><img src="'+h+'" class="immmg"><img src="'+d+'" class="immmg"><img src="'+l+'" class="immmg"></div><div class="main" id="box11">Bibliography</div><div class="main" id="box12"> Bibliography:<br> 1.
